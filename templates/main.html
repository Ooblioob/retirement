        <h4>The age you claim will affect your benefits, as well as your spouse’s.</h4>
        <p>If you or your spouse wait until full retirement age to claim, you will have claiming options such as “file and suspend” and “restricted application”. Additionally, if you are the higher earner in the household, it’s particularly important to wait until full retirement age because your spouse will receive a higher survivor benefit.</p>

If you stop or reduce your work hours, it’s still possible to increase your Social Security benefits by waiting to claim. You could use a portion of your 401(k) or other retirement savings to supplement your earnings. You’ll need to decide whether doing this is financially possible.</p>

        <p>You’re likely to spend 20 years in retirement and income needs are difficult to predict. During that time, you’ll need savings to pay for expenses like home repairs, medical bills, or even buying a car. Out-of-pocket health care costs will likely increase as you get older. You can make adjustments, like downsizing or paying off your mortgage before you retire. You can also wait to claim Social Security up to age 70, which increases your benefits, creating a buffer against future increases in expenses.</p>

        <p>You’re likely to spend 20 years in retirement and income needs are difficult to predict. During that time, you’ll need savings to pay for expenses like home repairs, medical bills, or even buying a car. Additionally, out-of-pocket health care costs are likely to increase as you get older. One solution is to wait to claim Social Security up to age 70, which increases your benefits. This will help other retirement savings, like 401(k)s, last longer.</p>

      <div class="lifestyle-response" data-responds-to="yes-under50">
        <h4>Continue to save for a secure retirement.</h4>
        <p>Social Security was never intended to be your only source of retirement income. That means your other sources, like savings, a 401(k) or an IRA will need to fill the gap. Waiting to claim your benefits (up to age 70) will ensure that this gap is as small as possible. If you claim before your full retirement age, your monthly benefit is permanently reduced by as much as 30 percent. Claiming early means that you will need to save more on your own for a secure retirement.</p>

        <h4>Take advantage of catch-up contributions.</h4>
        <p>Social Security was never intended to be your only source of retirement income. That means your other sources will need to fill this gap. Two steps you can take to ensure that this gap is as small as possible: 1) wait to claim your Social Security benefits (up to age 70) and 2) after age 50, take advantage of 401(k) annual catch-up contributions.</p>
        <p>Did you know retirement savings plans including 401(k)s come with penalties if you take your money out before age 59½? Consider accessing your 401(k) assets later in retirement.</p>
